  bio: Hi, my name is Dominik Schörkhuber. I am studying Informatics, Visual Computation Master at Technical University of Vienna. Currently I am working on my Diplomathesis in the field of Computer Vision, and working as Project Assistant at the Institute for Interactive Media Systems, TU Vienna. My main interests are Software Engineering, Computer Vision and Rendering, hence my field of study. Out of a request and demand situation I have also acquired quite a lot of skills recently in creating, designing and hosting websites and webservices.
